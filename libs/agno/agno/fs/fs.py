Conventions:
  - Paths are relative, like notes/decisions.md. Group related files in directories.
  - One topic, one file. Add dated entries as things develop; a note is a living document you maintain, not \
a log you only append to.
  - To correct or update part of a file, read it, then call replace_lines with the line numbers you saw. \
Never append a contradiction of what a note already says: fix the wording in place, in the same turn you \
learn it was wrong.
  - To find something, use search_content first: it reports the file and first-match line, which you can \
pass to read_file as start_line. Then answer from what the note says, not from memory.
  - To retire a note that is no longer current, move_file it into an archive/ directory. Do not blank it and \
do not overwrite it: its history may still be needed.
  - Store distilled content, not raw fetched payloads.
  - Never store secrets, passwords, or API keys.
  - Files have size limits. If a write is refused, split the topic into smaller files or archive what is \
finished. Never overwrite a note to make room if you might still need it."""

class FileSystem:
    """A durable, private filesystem scoped to one namespace.

    ``backend`` is a storage backend, or any storage handle FileSystem recognises
    (an agno ``SqliteDb``/``PostgresDb``, wrapped for you); ``namespace`` names this agent's file
    store within it, defaulting to ``"default"`` when you do not need more than
    one. Same ``backend`` + same ``namespace`` = same files; different
    ``namespace`` = full isolation. Sharing is explicit, by name. Isolation is per
    NORMALIZED name: literal namespace text is lowercased and URL-safe, so ``BANK``
    and ``bank`` address one store. Values bound to template placeholders preserve
    identity casing, so users ``Alice`` and ``alice`` remain isolated.

    ``namespace`` may embed the template placeholders ``{user_id}``,
    ``{agent_id}`` and ``{team_id}`` (e.g. ``"radar/{user_id}"``), resolved per
    tool call from framework-injected context only, never from model-supplied
    arguments. A placeholder whose value is missing at call time fails closed.
    Programmatic use of a templated instance goes through ``resolve()``.

    Files are further keyed by a user partition. On a user-scoped store
    (``user_scoped=True``) a run acts in the partition of its user, so two users
    of one namespace never see each other's files, and a run with no user is
    refused. ``user_scoped=False`` keeps the whole namespace shared whoever runs
    it. The default, ``None``, means shared, except that AgentOS sets it to its
    ``user_isolation`` setting on every store an agent holds, so isolation on
    the OS partitions the files. A user passed to ``resolve()`` selects that
    partition regardless.

    Use ``db=SqliteDb(...)`` or ``db=PostgresDb(...)`` to borrow a synchronous
    database, or ``backend=`` for an explicit backend. Supply exactly one source.

    ``read_only``, ``allow_delete``, ``include_tools`` and ``instructions`` shape
    the tools an agent gets from ``Agent(filesystem=...)`` (and the defaults of
    ``tools()``); they never restrict this object's own methods. To give agents
    different access to one store, create one FileSystem per access level on
    the same backend and namespace.

    Cheap to construct and holds no connections; the backend owns the
    engine/pool and is shared across instances.
