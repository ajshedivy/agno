"""Schemas for the pluggable authorization tier.

These six tables back the managed-roles product surface (``agno.os.authz``): the policy
and assignment tables the native policy engine decides from, the role metadata a
frontend renders, the credential-less user directory that carries the disabled-user
kill switch, and the two audit trails (who changed what, and every allow/deny).

They live here -- alongside every other agno table schema -- and are reached through the
``BaseDb`` contract (the ``*_authz_*`` methods, implemented by the sync SQLAlchemy
backends and inherited as ``NotImplementedError`` everywhere else) rather than being
declared inside the authz components. That means one place owns the schema, the tables
are created by the same schema-aware, migration-aware path as the rest of agno, they
honour a backend's configured schema and table-name overrides, and a database that
cannot support them says so plainly instead of being duck-typed for a SQLAlchemy engine
and failing later.

Column widths are deliberately unbounded (``String`` with no length): subjects are JWT
``sub`` claims and resources are scope strings, neither of which has a natural limit,
and the composite primary keys they take part in would otherwise collide with backend
index-length limits.
