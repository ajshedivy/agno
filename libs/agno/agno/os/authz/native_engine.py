"""The native managed-roles policy engine — agno's default, zero third-party deps.

A :class:`~agno.os.authz.engine.PolicyEngine` implemented directly in agno: roles
hold scopes (with allow/deny), subjects are assigned roles, and decisions use
**deny-overrides** matching the cloud RBAC semantics. No external policy engine.

Storage is **always a database** (``db`` / ``db_url``): policy + assignments live in
two SQLAlchemy tables (``authz_policy``, ``authz_grouping``) and every decision reads
them **fresh** with small indexed queries. There is no in-process cache, so a change
on one worker/replica is visible to all of them on their very next request — the
right default for AgentOS's multi-container deployments. Authz is a tiny,
index-served part of a request (which is otherwise an agent run), so the round-trips
are negligible, and a DB outage fails closed. A DB is *required*: an in-memory store
can't stay consistent across replicas, so an engine with no DB raises on any use
(see :data:`~agno.os.authz._db.NO_DB_MESSAGE`).

The decision model, in agno terms:

- a role's scopes are stored as ``(resource, action, effect)`` via the shared
  :mod:`~agno.os.authz._scope_policy` convention (deduped per ``(role, resource, action)``),
- a subject (or a token-carried role) is allowed an action on a resource iff some
  matching grant says *allow* and none says *deny* — evaluated per identity root
  and OR'd across token-carried roles, so a deny on one role can't silently veto
  an allow carried by another,
- a subject with NO role of its own (no assignment and no token-carried role) is
  treated as holding the ``is_default`` role, so "no role" is equivalent to the
  default role's permissions rather than an automatic deny (``disabled`` — not zero
  roles — is the lockout). This is decision-time only: nothing is written.
