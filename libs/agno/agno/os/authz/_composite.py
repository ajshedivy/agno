"""Run two authorization planes on one AgentOS, in parallel.

Real deployments often have two populations hitting the same OS:

- **Operators** — admins managing the OS through the agno-os frontend. agno's
  control plane mints them a token that already carries scopes, so they're
  authorized straight from the token (a :class:`ScopeAuthorizationProvider`).
- **End users** — the customer's own users, whose access is managed at runtime in
  the OS-local ``Authorization`` (its private role store). Their token
  carries identity; the store decides.

A single provider can't be both "trust the token's scopes" and "ignore the token,
ask the store." The public way to run several planes is ``Authorization(trust_token_scopes=True)``
with managed roles, or a **list** of providers on ``Authorization(authorization_provider=[...])``
for a bring-your-own setup — a request is allowed if any of them allows it::

    Authorization(verification_keys=KEYS, audience=OS_ID, authorization_provider=[
        ScopeAuthorizationProvider(),   # operators: scopes from the token
        roles.provider,                 # end users: the OS-local managed store
    ])

AgentOS composes that list with the internal class below. It's an OR, so order
only affects which provider is consulted first, not the outcome;
``accessible_resource_ids`` returns the union (``{"*"}`` wins). This class is an
implementation detail — prefer the list form above.

    turn one plane's outage into a 500 even when a healthy peer plane would grant.
    Each call site treats the error as "this plane grants nothing" and defers to the
