"""Resolving the database the authorization components persist to.

Authorization storage lives on the ``BaseDb`` contract (the ``*_authz_*`` methods in
:mod:`agno.db.base`, implemented by the sync SQLAlchemy backends and inherited as
``NotImplementedError`` everywhere else). These helpers are the only thing between a
user's ``db=`` / ``db_url=`` argument and that contract:

* :func:`db_from_url` turns a SQLAlchemy URL into the matching agno database, so
  ``Authorization(db_url=...)`` keeps working without the caller having to build a
  ``SqliteDb`` or ``PostgresDb`` themselves.
* :func:`supports_authz` asks whether a database implements the contract by CALLING it
  rather than by inspecting it -- a backend that inherits the stubs raises
  ``NotImplementedError`` and answers False.

The previous version of this module reached past the contract entirely: it duck-typed
any object for a ``.db_engine`` and the authz components then built and queried their own
SQLAlchemy tables. That worked only by accident on backends nobody had tried (MySQL
raised a key-length error, the async backends raised ``AttributeError``) and ignored a
backend's configured schema and table-name overrides.
