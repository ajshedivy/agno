"""The agno scope <-> policy convention.

How an agno scope string is written as a policy ``(resource, action)`` pair and

implementation, so policy is *written* and *checked* with the same spelling.

Resources use a ``type/id`` shape with ``/*`` for the collection/global form;
``agent_os:admin`` maps to the all-resources/all-actions wildcard ``("*", "*")``.
