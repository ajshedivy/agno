"""Audit trail for authorization changes.

There are two kinds of "audit" people mean, and we keep them in two separate
tables (see :class:`DbAuditSink`) because they answer different questions:

1. Decision audit ("was alice allowed to run agent X, and with which token?") —
   recorded by the JWT middleware on every protected request when an
   :class:`AuditSink` is set via ``Authorization(audit=...)``. Each row is an
   ``access.allowed`` / ``access.denied`` event with the principal, the route, the
   required scopes, the caller's scopes, and a NON-secret token reference (the
   token's ``jti`` when present, otherwise a short hash — never the token itself).
   (The native policy engine also logs every decision to the ``agno.authz.engine``
   logger.)

2. Change audit ("who granted alice the admin role, when, before/after?") — the
   policy engine cannot provide this: it never sees the acting principal, and its
   policy rows are overwrite-in-place with no history. So it must be captured at
   the layer that knows the actor — the management API / store. Plug an
   :class:`AuditSink` into ``Authorization(audit=...)``
   (directly or via ``get_roles_router``) and every role/assignment mutation emits
   a structured, append-only :class:`AuditEvent` with the actor and before/after.

The same :class:`DbAuditSink` instance can serve both: ``record()`` routes change
events to ``authz_audit`` and decision events to ``authz_decisions``.
