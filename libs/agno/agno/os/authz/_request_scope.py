"""A cache that lives for exactly one request.

One authorized request asks the policy store the same questions several times: the
route gate decides, then the per-resource gate decides again, and a list endpoint
additionally resolves the accessible and the denied id sets. Each of those recomputes
the caller's role closure and policy rows from scratch -- 2x on a resource GET, 4x on
a listing, every one of them identical and microseconds apart.

This memoizes those reads for the duration of a single request and throws the cache
away with it. That is deliberately NOT the in-process cache
:class:`~agno.os.authz.native_engine.NativePolicyEngine` refuses to keep: the point of
that refusal is that a revocation on one replica must be visible to every other replica
on their next request, and a per-request cache preserves that exactly -- it cannot
outlive the request that created it, so the next request everywhere reads fresh. Any
mutation through the store also clears it, so a role change made inside a request is
visible to the rest of that same request.

Scoped with a ``ContextVar`` rather than passed through the provider seam, so third-party
:class:`~agno.os.authz.provider.AuthorizationProvider` implementations neither see it nor
need to cooperate. Context is copied into threadpool workers, so it survives the
``run_in_threadpool`` hop FastAPI makes for sync dependencies.
