"""Authorization provider interface.

Defines the decision context handed to a provider and the abstract base every
provider implements. Keeping this dependency-free (only stdlib + typing) means
the interface can live in the OSS SDK while concrete providers — including ones
that call out to an external policy engine — are layered on top.

class AuthorizationContext:
    """Everything a provider needs to make an access decision.

    A provider is free to use as much or as little of this as its model
    requires. The built-in scope provider only looks at ``scopes`` /
    ``resource_type`` / ``resource_id`` / ``action`` / ``admin_scope``; a ReBAC
    or ABAC provider would additionally lean on ``principal_id`` and the full
    ``claims`` (tenant, groups, ownership hints, etc.).

    Attributes:
        principal_id: The authenticated subject (JWT ``sub``), or None when
            unauthenticated.
        scopes: Scope strings from the token's ``scopes`` claim.
        claims: The full decoded JWT payload, for providers that key off
            arbitrary claims (tenant_id, groups, ...).
        resource_type: Resource family being accessed ("agents", "teams",
            "workflows", ...), or None for non-resource checks.
        resource_id: Specific resource id, or None for list/collection checks.
        action: Action being attempted ("read", "run", "write", ...).
        admin_scope: The scope string that grants full bypass (default
            ``agent_os:admin``).

            IMPORTANT -- this is a *scope-plane* feature. It is honoured by
            :class:`~agno.os.authz.scope_provider.ScopeAuthorizationProvider`,
            which reads it off the caller's token scopes. Providers that do not
            authorize from token scopes deliberately ignore it and model admin in
            their own terms instead: the managed-role engine grants an admin ROLE
            (a role whose scopes include ``agent_os:admin``), and a relationship
            (ReBAC) provider expects an admin RELATIONSHIP. So a token carrying
            ``agent_os:admin`` is NOT automatically an admin under a role or ReBAC
            provider used on its own -- if you want token-scope admins alongside
            one of those, run the scope provider as a second plane
            (``authorization_provider=[ScopeAuthorizationProvider(), other]``),
            where the OR composition gives you the bypass.

        ``required_scopes`` is the scope vocabulary the default route→scope
        mapping produced for this path (e.g. ``["agents:run"]``). A scope-based
        provider uses it directly; a provider with a different model (ReBAC/ABAC)
        ignores it and decides from :meth:`check` instead.

        Default implementation gives a custom provider full control of the
        per-resource gate through :meth:`check`, without having to understand scope
        strings. :class:`~agno.os.authz.scope_provider.ScopeAuthorizationProvider`
        overrides this to preserve the original scope-matching behaviour.

        unset. By contract :meth:`check` DEFERS such a context (returns ``True``,
        leaving it to the route gate), so deferring to it here would ALLOW every
        non-resource route for any authenticated caller -- a full authorization
        bypass for a provider that only implements :meth:`check`. Such routes are not
        expressible as a per-resource question, so a provider that means to authorize
        them MUST override this method (deciding from ``required_scopes`` or its own
