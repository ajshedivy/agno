"""Per-request DB query budget for managed-roles authorization.

Pins the number of DB round-trips a single request's authz checks make, so a change
that reintroduces the per-call table re-resolution (an existence query + a schema
reflection before every authz query -- the bulk of the old cost) fails loudly.

The dominant fix is caching the resolved authz Table objects (db adapter); with it,
a steady-state request that resolves roles + policies and runs the kill-switch check
is a handful of small indexed reads, memoized so the route gate and the per-resource
gate share one resolution.
