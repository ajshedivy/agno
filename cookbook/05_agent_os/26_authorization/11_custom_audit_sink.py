Custom AuditSink - ship the audit trail wherever you keep your security events

(New to this? Read 05_managed_roles_audit.py first: it shows the two trails and the
`audit=True` switch that writes both to your database.)

`audit=True` stores the change trail and the decision trail in two tables in the object's
database. If your security events belong somewhere else (a SIEM, an append-only log, a
message queue, a file you rotate), hand `Authorization(audit=...)` your own AuditSink instead.
One class, one method:

    class MySink(AuditSink):
        def record(self, event: AuditEvent) -> None: ...

Every event on BOTH trails comes through it:

  - changes    role.set_scopes / role.removed / user.assigned / user.unassigned, with the
               acting admin (`actor`), the `target`, and a before/after diff;
  - decisions  access.allowed / access.denied for every protected request, with the caller
               as `actor`, "METHOD /path" as `target`, and metadata holding the scopes the
               route required and a NON-secret reference to the token (its jti or a short
               hash, never the token itself).

`record` must never raise into the request path; agno catches and logs a failing sink, but
a sink that swallows its own errors keeps the log clean. The async request path calls
`arecord`, whose default runs `record` in a worker thread, so a sync sink is enough.

Reading back: `authz.audit_log()` and `authz.decisions()` read from the database sink. A custom
sink owns its own storage, so it owns its own reads too (this one tails its file).

This file writes both trails as JSON lines to tmp/authz_audit.jsonl, makes a few changes and
requests, then prints the file. No server and no model key needed.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 11_custom_audit_sink.py
