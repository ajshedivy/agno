Directory without auth - the user directory is just a roster, no login required

02_managed_users.py showed the directory with a real kill switch, backed by verified
tokens. This shows the OTHER end - NO auth at all. The whole config is:

    AgentOS(db=db, user_isolation=True, user_directory=True)

That is it. No JWT, no keys, no identity provider. A run comes in with a user_id and
that person just shows up in the directory, and their data is scoped to them. This is
the "just let me see it work" path for local dev and demos.

The idea: a user directory is data (who exists), not a login. So if a run comes in as
"chegizkhan", chegizkhan should just appear. user_isolation is the same - it scopes a
run's own data by its user_id.

What you get without auth:
- A roster. Every run's user_id lands in the directory (user_directory=True turns on
  auto-provision), so you can SEE everyone who has shown up.
- Per-user data. user_isolation=True scopes each run's data by its user_id.

What you do NOT get without auth (read this):
- Enforcement. With no verified identity the user_id is whatever the caller types, so
  both the `disabled` flag AND isolation are ADVISORY here, not a boundary - a caller
  could dodge them by sending a different id. They become real the moment you add
  AgentOS(authorization=True) with a verification key. See 02_managed_users.py.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=...   # this file makes a real (tiny) run per user
    python 03_directory_without_auth.py
