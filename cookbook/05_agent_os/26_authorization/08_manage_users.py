Run an AgentOS that serves the USER management API (no roles) - for a frontend

Sibling of 07_manage_users_and_roles.py, but users ONLY: a directory (who exists +
the disabled off-switch) with NO role store. End users are authorized by their
token scopes (a control plane / IdP issues them); AgentOS just keeps the roster
and the kill-switch. Use this when roles live elsewhere and you only need AgentOS
to manage the list of people.

What it serves (admin-only):
    GET    /users            list users (search/sort/paginate)
    POST   /users            add a user
    PATCH  /users/{id}       update; {"disabled": true} revokes on next request

There is NO /authz roles API here (no role store), so a frontend renders a plain
"User Management" page with no role selector - the difference from
07_manage_users_and_roles.py.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 08_manage_users.py
Then point your frontend at http://localhost:7777 (CORS open to the dev ports).
The server keeps running until you Ctrl-C.

Verifying tokens - auto-selected by env, no code change:
  - Dev (default): a built-in HS256 secret. On startup it prints a ready-made
    admin bearer (with the agent_os:admin scope) to paste into the frontend / curl.
  - Control plane / IdP: set JWT_JWKS_FILE or JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY (+ OS_ID, and
    optionally JWT_ISSUER); operators' own tokens carry agent_os:admin.

Admin here comes from the TOKEN's agent_os:admin scope, not a seeded store row -
there is no role store to seed an admin in. That is the whole point of this file.
