Managed Roles - the audit trail (who changed what, and every allow/deny)

New to this? Read 01_managed_roles.py first.

Once people can change roles at runtime, you need to answer two questions later:

  1. "Who gave Bob admin, and when?"        -> the CHANGE trail
  2. "Was Alice allowed to delete that?"    -> the DECISION trail

agno keeps these as two separate, append-only tables (rows are only ever inserted,
never updated or deleted - tamper-evident, the kind of thing an auditor wants):

  - authz_audit      : one row per role/assignment change, with the actor and a
                       before/after diff.
  - authz_decisions  : one row per protected request, allow or deny, with the
                       route, the scopes required, and a NON-secret reference to
                       the token used (its `jti`, or a short hash - never the token
                       itself).

You turn it on with `Authorization(audit=True)`: one switch, both trails, written to the
object's database. (Pass your own `AuditSink` instead to ship events elsewhere; see
11_custom_audit_sink.py.) Every change and every decision is recorded from then on.

This file makes a few role changes and a couple of real requests, then prints both
trails. No server, no OpenAI key needed.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 05_managed_roles_audit.py
