"""Fine-grained / relationship-based authorization (ReBAC) for AgentOS.

RBAC says "what may a *role* do?". Sometimes that's not enough — you want "alice
may run *this* workflow because she *owns the folder it's in*", or "a member of
team-x may read the agents that belong to team-x". That's relationship-based
access control (ReBAC), the model behind OpenFGA / WorkOS FGA / Zanzibar.

AgentOS doesn't embed a relationship engine — it plugs one in through the same
`AuthorizationProvider` seam everything else uses. `FGAAuthorizationProvider`
turns each AgentOS check into one relationship query:

    can alice RUN agents:research-agent?  ->  fga.check("user:alice", "run", "agents:research-agent")
    which agents can alice READ?          ->  fga.list_objects("user:alice", "read", "agents")

Run this example:
    python 15_fga_relationship_based.py

It uses a tiny in-memory relationship store so it runs with zero infra. For
production you swap that one object for OpenFGA (or WorkOS FGA) — see the bottom.

The idiomatic wiring composes TWO providers (a feature of AgentOS): FGA decides
the per-resource families (agents/teams/workflows) relationally, while the scope
provider gates everything else (config, sessions, ...) — because FGA has no
notion of a non-resource route. A request is allowed if either grants.
