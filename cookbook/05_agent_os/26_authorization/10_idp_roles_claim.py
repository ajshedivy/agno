"""
Roles on the token: Authorization(roles_claim=...) for an external identity provider

(New to this? Read 01_managed_roles.py first. 13_idp_workos_auth0.py shows the same IdP
setup with a custom provider and real RS256/JWKS verification; this file is the built-in
version of that integration.)

When WorkOS, Auth0 or Okta own your users, they already know each person's role and put it
on the token as a claim (Auth0 sends a list under "roles"; WorkOS sends one string under
"role"). You do not want to mirror every user into agno and `assign` them a role by hand.

`roles_claim` splits the work the natural way:

  - YOU define what each role may do, once, in code:   authz.define_role("member", [...])
  - THE TOKEN says which role the caller holds:        {"sub": "alice", "roles": ["member"]}

No per-user `assign` is needed. The role definitions live in your database, so the /authz
admin API can still edit what a role may do at runtime, and `audit=True` still records it.

Two details worth knowing:

  - A token whose claim names a role you never defined grants nothing (carol below).
  - A token with NO roles claim falls back to stored assignments, so `authz.assign` still
    works for the few subjects your IdP does not cover (erin below, and service accounts).
  - A caller whose token carries a role that grants `agent_os:admin` can use the /authz
    admin API, so "admin" can live in your IdP too (root below).

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 10_idp_roles_claim.py
(no external services and no model key: it decides who is allowed, without calling a model.)
