Custom AuthorizationProvider - the minimal "bring your own decision engine" path.

(New to authorization? Read 01_managed_roles.py first. For a production-shaped custom
provider that integrates a login service like WorkOS/Auth0, see 13_idp_workos_auth0.py.)

The scope tier (default) and the managed-roles tier both think in agno SCOPES. If
your access model isn't scopes - it's ReBAC ("is this user an owner of this
resource?"), ABAC ("same tenant?"), or a call out to your own policy engine - you
write an AuthorizationProvider and plug it in. That ONE object is the whole
integration; the rest of AgentOS (the request pipeline, the two enforcement points)
stays the same.

An AuthorizationProvider answers two questions (the ABC's two abstract methods):

  - check(ctx)                  -> "may THIS caller do THIS action on THIS resource?"
  - accessible_resource_ids(ctx)-> for list endpoints: which ids may they see?
                                   ({"*"} means "all of them".)

Two more methods you can override:

  - authorize_route(ctx, required_scopes)  the route-level gate the JWT middleware
                                   runs BEFORE the request reaches a handler. It
                                   governs EVERY mapped route, including the ones with
                                   no resource_type (/sessions, /config, /metrics,
                                   /databases/all/migrate, ...). The ABC default fails
                                   those closed (it cannot express a non-resource
                                   question), so a provider that means to authorize
                                   them MUST override this -- see below.
  - require / filter_accessible    built on check / accessible_resource_ids.

The example below uses a deliberately tiny, NON-scope decision model to make the
seam obvious: the token carries a `tier` claim, and a small Python dict says what
each tier may do. Swap the body of check()/accessible_resource_ids() for a call to
your own engine and nothing else changes.

Run it:
    pip install agno
    python 12_custom_authorization_provider.py
(no extra services, no database needed - we only check who is allowed.)
