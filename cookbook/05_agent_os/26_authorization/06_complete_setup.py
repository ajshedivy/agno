"""
The complete built-in setup on one page - roles, users, audit and the admin API together

(Read 01_managed_roles.py to 05_managed_roles_audit.py first; each of those introduces one
piece. This file puts every piece together the way a real deployment wires them, and
07_manage_users_and_roles.py serves exactly this setup for a frontend.)

What is on the page:

1. A user directory (the roster), seeded with three people and set to auto-provision anyone
   else who arrives with a valid token.
2. Roles: admin, viewer (the default a brand-new user gets) and runner, with alice bootstrapped
   as the admin and the others handed a role. Safe to run on every start.
3. The audit trail, on with one switch.
4. Two enforcement planes at once: the managed roles for end users, and the token's own scopes
   for an operator token minted elsewhere (trust_token_scopes=True).
5. The admin API, mounted for you: /authz for roles and /users for the directory.

Permissions are written as "scopes":
- "agents:*:read"             -> can look at any agent
- "agents:research:run"       -> can run the one agent called research
- "agent_os:admin"            -> can do everything

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 06_complete_setup.py
(no OpenAI key needed here - we only check who is allowed, not actually chat)
