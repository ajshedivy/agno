Managed Users - a user directory for AgentOS, no identity provider needed

Already did 01_managed_roles.py? That showed ROLES (who can do what). This shows
USERS (who exists), for the case where you DON'T have an external login system
(no Okta/Auth0/WorkOS). Your own app still signs people in its own way and hands
them a token; AgentOS keeps the list of users and decides what they can do.

Important: AgentOS does NOT store passwords and does not log anyone in. It keeps
a directory - just id, optional email/name, and an on/off switch per person -
plus their roles. Think "address book with an off switch", not "login system".

Why bother keeping users at all (instead of only roles)?
1. You can SEE everyone who exists and pick a person to give a role to, instead
   of typing a raw id you have to remember.
2. You get a real OFF SWITCH. Disable someone and their very next request is
   blocked - even though their token is still valid and unexpired. A token alone
   can't be "un-issued"; the directory can.
3. The audit trail can say "bob@co" instead of an opaque id.

This file creates a few users, gives them roles, then:
- lists the directory,
- shows bob working normally,
- DISABLES bob and shows his next request bounce (same valid token),
- re-enables him,
- and shows a brand-new user auto-provision on their first request, landing usable
  with the default role - no admin step in between.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 02_managed_users.py
(no OpenAI key needed - we are only checking who is allowed, not chatting)
