User management metrics: GET /users/metrics

The users admin API also serves the numbers a User Management page shows about the
directory, computed live on every read (no cache, no refresh step):

    total / active / disabled   the directory as it is now, plus without_role
    created_per_day             users created per UTC day (a line chart)
    by_role                     users per role (slug and display name), when a role
                                store is configured

Every user in GET /users carries role_name next to role_slug for the same reason: a page
can show "Data analyst" without a second request to /authz/roles.

It rides on the same router as /users, so it is admin-only and is mounted wherever
user management is: AgentOS mounts /users whenever it has a user directory, with or
without roles (see 08_manage_users.py for the users-only setup). Deleting a user
moves every number at once.

This example seeds a directory and a role store, then reads the endpoint through
the AgentOS pipeline with an admin token and prints the response. No model calls
and no database server are needed.

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 09_user_management_metrics.py
