"""
Run an AgentOS that serves the user + role management API (for a frontend)

(New to this? Read 01_managed_roles.py first, then 02_managed_users.py.)

This is the "admin backend": it starts a real AgentOS server and leaves it
running, exposing the /authz management API so a frontend (or your own admin UI)
can create roles, add users, assign roles, and disable people - live. It works
both with a control plane / login service (operators authorized by their token
scopes) and on its own (end users managed in the OS-local store) - both at once.

What it serves (all admin-only). Authorization (roles) and the top-level user directory together
mount the roles admin API (/authz) and the user directory (/users) for you -- no include_router:
    GET    /authz/roles                 list roles
    POST   /authz/roles                 create a role (PUT/PATCH .../{slug}/scopes for permissions)
    GET    /authz/scopes                the permission catalog (for a UI grid)
    POST   /authz/subjects/{id}/roles      set a user's role (replaces)  -- role assignment is authz
    GET    /authz/audit                 the change trail (search/sort/paginate)
    GET    /authz/decisions             the access trail (search/sort/paginate)
    GET    /users                       list users (one role each; search/sort/paginate)
    POST   /users                       add a user
    PATCH  /users/{id}                  update; {"disabled": true} revokes on next request

It seeds a couple of roles and users so the frontend has something to show, and
makes ONE bootstrap admin (so someone can call the admin API).

Run it:
    pip install "agno[os]"
    python 07_manage_users_and_roles.py
Then point your frontend at http://localhost:7777 (CORS is open to the usual dev
ports). The server keeps running until you Ctrl-C.

Two authz planes run in parallel here, by default -- ``Authorization(trust_token_scopes=True)``
runs a scope plane next to the role store, and a request is allowed if either grants:
  - control plane / operators: a token that already carries scopes (e.g. an
    agno-cloud / frontend token) is authorized straight from those scopes.
  - managed store / end users: everyone else is authorized against the OS-local
    role store you manage at runtime.
So a scope-bearing frontend token can connect and operate, while the store still
governs your managed users.

Verifying tokens - pick whichever fits; auto-selected by env, no code change:
  - Dev (default): a built-in HS256 secret. On startup it prints a ready-made
    admin bearer token you can paste into the frontend / curl to try the API.
  - Control plane / IdP: set ONE of
        JWT_JWKS_FILE         path to a JWKS downloaded from your IdP (RS256)
        JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY  your OS public key (RS256) or an HS256 secret
    plus OS_ID (the token audience / your os_id) and, optionally,
        JWT_ISSUER           pin the issuer, e.g. "agent-os-api"

To MANAGE roles/users over /authz you must be an admin. That comes from either an
``agent_os:admin`` scope on the token, OR being seeded in the store - so set
ADMIN_SUBJECT to the `sub` of your token (decode it: the `sub` claim). e.g.
    OS_ID="<your-os-id>" JWT_VERIFICATION_KEY="<os public key>" \\
    ADMIN_SUBJECT="you@company.com" python 07_manage_users_and_roles.py
